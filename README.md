## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yetanothermlp.git
cd yetanothermlp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We recommend using a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll need:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- PyCUDA (for GPU acceleration)
- Rust (for compiling the Rust code)

### 3. Run Tests

You can explore the model functionality with:

```bash
python test.py
```

Or dive into the notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook tests_mlp.ipynb
```

---

## 📈 Results & Benchmarks

You can find comparisons and performance results in the notebooks or logs generated by `test_dll_mlp.py` and `optimized_cuda.py`.

---

## 🧠 Motivation

This project is designed for experimentation with various MLP architectures and hardware optimizations. By combining Rust and Python, the goal is to achieve both speed and flexibility.

# If i fail this project, i can't graduate Bac+3.
